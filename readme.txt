EarthArtFinder will be an app that allows the user to view or find artpieces throughout the world using google maps and display the current temperature/weather condition
where the selected artpiece is located the app will pull in information from Google Maps API for the map and Dark Sky API for weather to accomplish this.  The user, while in portrait display, 
will display a google maps layout and while in landscape will display both the google maps view on the left side of the screen 
and the sliding menu select on the right side of the screen. On the right side of the screen the user will be able to select from a pre-populated
list of landmarks and artpieces in the world. Tapping on an item in the list will bring the user to the associated landmark and will display the name,
a description of the artpiece, the name of the artist, when it was finished and weather conditions.
