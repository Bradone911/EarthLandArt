EarthArtFinder will be an app that allows the user to view and find artpieces throughout the world using google maps and display the current temperature/weather condition
where the selected artpiece is located. The app will pull in information from Google Maps API for the map and Dark Sky API for weather to accomplish this. In portrait view,
Tapping on an item in the 
list will change 
to a view that shows a description view and picture of the landart. On the description view there 
will be a button that, when pressed, will change to google maps view and bring the user to the associated landart and will display the name, and weather conditions.   
In landscape the 
left side of the screen will be the scrolling pre-populated
list of artpieces and the right side will default to the description view of the first landart piece in the list. CLicking on the map button in the description view
will change the right
side of the screen to google maps view and bring the user to its coordinates, there will also be a back button on this map view. If the user clicks on another landart in the list,
the right side will always go to the description view and not reroute to the position of the newly selected landart in the maps view.
